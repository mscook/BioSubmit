BioSubmit
=========

Next Generation Sequencing data submission for Humans!

**This is a work in progress.** I would much appreciate collaboration!

Does the documentation at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/submit_and_update or 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK47525/ drive you f*cking bonkers?

Have more data than you can poke a stick [at]?

Do you really hate editing files by [hand]?

**Then why not try BioSubmit?** It generates XML submissions from 
given configuration files!


.. [at] LOL - if you're outside of USA or EU it may still take an eternity 

.. [hand] LOL - you may have 100's of projects/data files to submit
